# Final Assignment Guidelines

## Network Analysis
### An Introduction for Humanists 

Teacher: Dr Katarzyna Anna Kapitan

## **Overview**

For your final assignment, you will submit a **project report** along with a **data asset** that demonstrates your ability to apply network analysis concepts, use the NetworkX package in Python, and engage with seminar readings on network analysis in the humanities.

Your submission will consist of:

1. **Project Report** (1500–2500 words)   
2. **Data Asset** (consisting of unprocessed data, Python code, Network visualisation) 

## **Project Report Requirements**

Your report should be structured as follows:

### **1\. Introduction (10%)**

* Provide a clear research question or objective.   
* Explain why you selected this dataset and how it relates to network analysis in the humanities. 

### **2\. Data and Methods (25%)**

* Describe the raw dataset and how you processed it for analysis.   
* Explain the network construction process (e.g., nodes, edges, weights, directed/undirected network).   
* Discuss any preprocessing, cleaning, or transformations applied.   
* Present the measures you used and why they are relevant (e.g., centrality, clustering coefficient, density, modularity). 

### **3\. Results and Discussion (35%)**

* Present key findings from your network analysis.   
* Interpret the meaning of the network structure and measures in relation to your research question.   
* Include and explain at least one network visualisation.   
* Reflect on any challenges faced and decisions made in the analysis. 

### **4\. Engagement with Lectures and Readings (20%)**

* Demonstrate understanding of theoretical and methodological concepts discussed in class.   
* Reference at least two seminar readings relevant to your project and apply their insights to your analysis.   
* Critically evaluate how network analysis helped (or failed to help) in answering your research question. 

### **5\. Conclusion (10%)**

* Summarise the main insights from your analysis.   
* Suggest possible next steps or further questions arising from your study. 

## **Data Asset Requirements**

* **Raw Data**: Provide a spreadsheet or other source file that reflects the unprocessed dataset.   
* **Code**: Submit Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook files that document how you processed the data and calculated network measures.   
* **Visualisations**: Include network diagrams with clear labels and legends. 

## **Submission Format**

* Submit the project report as a **PDF**.   
* Provide the data asset as a **.zip file** containing all relevant materials.   
* Name your files as: LastName\_NetworkAnalysis\_Report.pdf and LastName\_NetworkAnalysis\_Data.zip. 


## **Evaluation Rubric**

| Criteria | Excellent (90-100%) | Good (75-89%) | Satisfactory (60-74%) | Needs Improvement (\<60%) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Introduction** | Clearly defines research question and relevance of dataset | Research question is clear but needs more justification | Topic is relevant but lacks a strong research question | Weak or unclear research question |
| **Data & Methods** | Thorough description of data processing and analysis; well-justified choice of measures | Mostly clear explanation with some missing details | Methods are described but lack depth or justification | Methods unclear or poorly explained |
| **Results & Discussion** | Strong interpretation of network structure with clear visualisation; insightful discussion | Solid findings with some interpretation gaps | Basic discussion with limited analysis | Weak discussion, little engagement with findings |
| **Engagement with Readings** | Well-integrated references, deep engagement with key texts | Engages with readings but lacks critical reflection | References readings but superficially | Minimal or no reference to readings |
| **Conclusion** | Strong synthesis of findings and future directions | Summarises findings but lacks forward-looking insights | Basic summary without deeper insight | No meaningful conclusion |
| **Data Asset** | Well-organised, reproducible code and clear visualisations | Some minor issues in reproducibility or clarity | Code is functional but lacks comments or clarity | Disorganised or incomplete data assets |


## **Due Date**

All submissions must be sent  to your teacher by email by **11 May, 23:59 (Paris time)**.

Late submissions won’t be accepted and will result in failing the class. 

## **Academic Integrity**

Ensure all sources, including seminar readings and external references, are properly cited. Any form of plagiarism will result in academic penalties according to university regulations.

If you have any questions, please reach out during office hours or via email. 

**Happy analysing!**
